"""
BarrelLabs SwingAI — Entitlements

Single source of truth for every "can this user do X?" question. Every
feature gate in the app should call into this module so we never end
up with inconsistent paywalls across pages.

Design rules:
  • Plan-level capabilities live in PLAN_CAPS (a flat dict-of-dicts).
  • Per-user state (which plan, usage counters) comes from
    subscription_storage.load_my_plan() — this module never talks to
    Supabase directly.
  • Every public function returns either a bool or an EntitlementResult
    so call sites can render meaningful upgrade prompts.

Usage:
    from entitlements import can_analyze_swing, can_save_drill_plan
    ok, reason, upgrade_to = can_analyze_swing()
    if not ok:
        show_paywall(reason, upgrade_to)
